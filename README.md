# Mini-Processor-Simulator
Core part of a mini processor simulator called MySPIM using the C language on a Unix/Linux platform. MySPIM demonstrates some functions of the MIPS processor as well as the principle of separating the data-path from the control signals of the MIPS processor. The MySPIM simulator reads in a file containing MIPS machine code (in a specified the format) and simulates what MIPS does cycle-by-cycle (single-cycle data path).
